# Simple Rust Todo App
A very simple web app built in Rust that utilises web assembly to send messages to a reactive component.

## Usage
All styles and settings have been set up.
To run the app locally, just call `serve.sh` script that contains a command to generate a TailwindCSS file, as well as compiling and servering the Rust application to localhost.
```powershell
$ sh serve.sh
```
